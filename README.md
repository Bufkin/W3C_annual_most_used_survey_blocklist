This blocklist is based on surveys of most used advertising and tracking technology (e.g. surveys of W3C, W3Tech and the
on-line marketing community itself). The online advertising industry likes to keep lists of top performing companies in
the ad supply chain (including advertising excanhe platforms). The list and surveys monitored are oriented on Europe and 
North America, this is the reason this blocklist contains mostly EU and US based advertising and tracking networks. 

                                WHY USE A SMALL ADVERTISING AND TRACKING NETWORKS BLOCK LIST? 
In advertising the number one (Google) has a marketshare of around 40 percent, Facebook the number two hits the 20 percent mark 
while the number three Comscore just has a little over 2.5% marketshare. For comparison Amazon with its huge webstore generates 
about the same advertising traffic on its own website. Number 100 on this list is probably used at 5000 websites of the Alexa 
Top 300.000 websites, while number 250 may only track you on 500 websites of the Alexa Top 300.000. 

                                                  LOW UPDATE FREQUENCY
Because this list focusses on the advertising and tracking networks which place the adds on the websites you visit, this list 
is not subjective to a lot of changes. Simply because it takes a lot of rime and money to build such a backbone (ad serving) 
network. Also the digital marketeers using these networks are a constraining factor, because most don't like to learn how to
use the software (used for advertisement placement and visitor tracking). 

                                                      ADVICED USAGE 
When you decide to use this compact filter it is good practice to add the optimized Easylist English filter of Adguard
and your native language Easylist filter. Thanks to to the ongoing efforst of Brave to remove dead rules the original 
Easylist filter is reduced in size by roughly 50 percent. The optimized Easylist filter of AdGuard uses a subset of the
English Easylist filter (around 25% of the rules). The optimized AdGuard list only contains the rules which are triggered 
often (so it excludes the rules you probabaly never use). This combined (small and longlist) approach will provide you with 
90% of the ad and tracking protection with only 10% of the number of block rules (compared to uBlock Origin default).
