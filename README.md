This blocklist is based on surveys of most used advertising and tracking technology (e.g. surveys of W3C, W3Tech and the
on-line marketing community itself). The online advertising industry likes to keep lists of top performing companies in
the ad supply chain (including advertising excanhe platforms). The list and surveys monitored are oriented on Europe and 
North America, this is the reason this blocklist contains mostly EU and US based advertising and tracking networks. 

                                WHY USE A SMALL ADVERTISING AND TRACKING NETWORKS BLOCK LIST? 
In advertising the number one (Google) has a marketshare of around 40 percent, Facebook the number two hits the 20 percent mark 
while the number three Comscore just has a little over 2.5% marketshare. For comparison Amazon with its huge webstore generates 
about the same advertising traffic on its own website. Number 100 on this list is probably used at 5000 websites of the Alexa 
Top 300.000 websites, while number 250 may only track you on 500 websites of the Alexa Top 300.000. 

                                                      ADVICED USAGE 
When you decide to use this compact filter it is good practice to add your language specific Easylist English and your native
language Easylist filter. Thanks to to the ongoing efforst of Brave to remove dead filters the original Easylist filter is 
also reduced by 50 percent. As an alternative to Easylist you coudl use the Optimized easylist filter of Adguard. This list
contains a subset (around 25%) of the rules which are triggered often (so it excludes the rules you probabaly never use). 
This will combined (small and longlist ) approach will provide you with 90% of the ad and tracking protection with only 10% of 
the number of block rules.
